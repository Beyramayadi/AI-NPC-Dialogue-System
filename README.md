Instructions will be added as the project progresses.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Sample dialogue datasets.
- `models/`: Scripts for fine-tuning and optimizing LLMs.
- `backend/`: FastAPI-based API for real-time dialogue generation.
- `game-engine/`: Files for Unity/Unreal integration.

## To-Do
- [ ] Define game scenario and sample dialogues.
- [ ] Build and test backend API.
